# About

A speech transcription and translation application using whisper AI

# Development

## Incompatibility

As of right now (4th of November 2022) pytorch is not compatible with python 3.11 so you cann't use python 3.11. I use python 3.10.8.

## Setup

1. Create your virtual environment by running `python -m venv venv`
2. Activate your virtual environment by running `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Navigate to the `speech_translate` directory, and run `python __init__.py`
