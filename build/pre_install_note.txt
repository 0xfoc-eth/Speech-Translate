Thank you for downloading Speech Translate.

Speech Translate is a practical application that combines OpenAI's Whisper ASR model with free translation APIs. It serves as a versatile tool for both real-time / live speech-to-text and speech translation, allowing the user to seamlessly convert spoken language into written text. Additionally, it has the option to import and transcribe audio / video files effortlessly.  

Requirements:
- Windows 8.1 or higher for speaker input
- Internet connection (for translation with API & downloading models)
- Each whisper model requires the following VRAM:
  * tiny (~1 GB)
  * base (~1 GB)
  * small (~2 GB)
  * medium (~5 GB)
  * large (~10 GB)

Whisper can be used with CPU but will be very limited / slow when doing so. It is recommended to use a cuda compatible GPU for better performance.
  
Please also note that when using faster-whisper, the speed will be significantly faster and the model size will be reduced depending on the usage. For more information about this please visit https://github.com/guillaumekln/faster-whisper
